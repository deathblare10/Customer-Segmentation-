# Customer-Segmentation-

### Introduction 

Customer segmentation is a critical technique in marketing and business analytics that involves dividing a customer base into distinct groups based on their characteristics, behaviors, or preferences. These segments allow businesses to better understand their customers, design targeted marketing strategies, and improve customer satisfaction and retention. This project implements a **Shiny app** for performing interactive customer segmentation analysis.

The app is designed to handle common customer data, typically containing attributes like **gender**, **age**, **annual income**, and **spending score**. By leveraging these attributes, the app helps users explore the data visually, clean it effectively, and identify clusters of similar customers through **K-means clustering**, a widely used unsupervised machine learning algorithm.



### Purpose and Objectives

The main objectives of this project are:
1. **Streamlined Data Preprocessing**: Provide tools to clean customer data by removing duplicates and handling missing values.
2. **Data Exploration**: Enable users to visualize key customer characteristics and distributions.
3. **Customer Segmentation**: Use K-means clustering to segment customers into distinct groups based on attributes like annual income and spending score.
4. **Cluster Evaluation**: Offer methods like the silhouette score and elbow method to assess the quality and number of clusters.

This app empowers business analysts, data scientists, and marketers to perform customer segmentation interactively without requiring advanced programming skills.

### Features of the Shiny App

#### **1. Data Cleaning**
- **Remove Duplicates**: Ensures the data does not contain duplicate rows, which could skew results.
- **Handle Missing Values**: Removes rows with missing values to maintain data integrity.

These options make it easy to preprocess raw datasets before analysis.

#### **2. Data Visualization**
Users can select from the following visualization options to explore the data:
- **Gender Distribution**: Displays the gender distribution of customers as a bar chart.
- **Age Distribution**: Groups ages into intervals (e.g., 18-25, 26-35) and visualizes the distribution as a bar plot.
- **Annual Income Distribution**: Uses a density plot to display the spread of customer incomes.
- **Spending Score Distribution**: Visualizes spending scores (scaled 1-100) as a density plot.

These visualizations help users understand the structure of their customer base before segmentation.

#### **3. Clustering Analysis**
The app uses **K-means clustering** to segment customers based on numerical attributes such as:
- **Annual Income**
- **Spending Score**

Key clustering features include:
- **Cluster Visualization**: Displays the results of clustering as scatter plots with distinct colors for each cluster.
- **Silhouette Score**: Evaluates how well the clusters are formed and separated.
- **Elbow Plot**: Helps determine the optimal number of clusters by minimizing within-cluster variance.

### Technical Workflow

1. **Upload Customer Data**:
   - Users upload a CSV file containing customer data with columns like **Gender**, **Age**, **Annual Income**, and **Spending Score**.

2. **Preprocess the Data**:
   - The app automatically removes duplicates and missing values based on user preferences.

3. **Explore Data**:
   - Users select from several plot types to visualize the distributions of customer attributes.

4. **Run Clustering**:
   - Users specify the number of clusters for the K-means algorithm and analyze results through:
     - **Cluster Plots**: Visualizes customers in clusters with clear boundaries.
     - **Silhouette Score**: Quantifies cluster quality.
     - **Elbow Plot**: Suggests the optimal number of clusters.

### Expected Input Data Format

The uploaded data should include the following columns:
- **Gender**: Customer gender (e.g., Male/Female).
- **Age**: Customer age as a numeric value.
- **Annual.Income..k..**: Annual income of the customer in thousands.
- **Spending.Score..1.100.**: Spending score on a scale of 1 to 100.

Example data:

| Gender | Age | Annual.Income..k.. | Spending.Score..1.100. |
|--------|-----|---------------------|-------------------------|
| Male   | 23  | 40                  | 60                      |
| Female | 35  | 70                  | 85                      |

### Benefits of Customer Segmentation

1. **Personalized Marketing**: Tailor campaigns to meet the needs of specific customer groups.
2. **Resource Optimization**: Focus resources on high-value customer segments.
3. **Improved Customer Retention**: Design programs to retain customers based on their behaviors and preferences.
4. **Increased Revenue**: Identify and target high-potential customers effectively.

This Shiny app makes the process of customer segmentation more accessible, enabling businesses to derive actionable insights from their data with minimal effort.
